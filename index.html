                Worried that you’re not compliant with the Real ID act that is about to take effect for Arizonians on May 3, 2023?
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, Arizona has allocated approximately <a href="https://eu.azcentral.com/story/travel/airlines/2022/07/18/real-id-deadline-2023/10053983002/">1.7 million Travel IDs</a> as of July 6, with 202,559 in 2022. And when the new requirements come into play next May, Real IDs will be a requirement in order for you to board any aircraft or enter secure federal buildings.
            </p>
            <p>
                We know this all sounds a little intimidating, but don’t worry. We’ve got you covered. Keep reading because this article will tell you everything you need to know about getting a Travel ID Arizona, including the requirements and where to go.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>What Is a Travel ID?</h2>
            <p>
                A travel ID is an identification document that allows you to travel both domestically and internationally. It contains your name, photograph, and other identifying information such as your date of birth, gender, and address.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you plan to travel outside of the United States, you will need a passport. A passport is a travel ID that is issued by the federal government and is valid for 10 years. If you do not have a passport, you can apply for one at a passport acceptance facility.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are traveling within the United States, you may be able to use an alternative form of ID such as a driver’s license or state-issued ID card. However, some states now require that you have a travel ID to board an airplane.

            <h2>Am I Required to Get an Arizona Travel ID?</h2>
            <p>
                If you plan to fly domestically, the answer is yes. The REAL ID Act was enacted by Congress and it set unique measures for the issuance of driver’s licenses and state-issued ID cards.
            </p>
            <p>
                To board a domestic flight, you will need an ID that meets the requirements of the REAL ID Act. A driver’s license or state-issued ID card from a compliant state will work.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your state is not in keeping with the REAL ID Act, you will need an alternative form of ID such as a passport. Arizona is not currently in keeping with the REAL ID Act, so if you plan to fly domestically, you will need an alternative form of ID.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>Can I Still Use My Current License to Board an Airplane?</h2>
            <p>
                The act set benchmarks for state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards and required them to be more tamper-resistant and to include security features such as a digital photograph and Social Security number. The act also created a deadline for states to comply with the new standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally, that deadline was January 1, 2008. However, it has been pushed back several times, and the <a href="https://www.ggandd.com/blog/real-id-deadline-delayed/">current deadline is May 2023</a>. This means that if your state is not compliant with the REAL ID Act by that date, you will need an alternative form of ID such as a passport to board a domestic flight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, many states are already compliant with the REAL ID Act, so the extended majority of Americans will not be impacted by this change. However, if your state is currently non-compliant, you should start making plans now to get an alternative form of ID. Otherwise, you may find yourself grounded come May 2023.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>What Are the Arizona Travel ID Requirements?</h2>
            <p>
                The requirements for an Arizona travel ID are the same as the requirements for any other state-issued ID. Let’s look at them in more detail:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You must be a U.S. citizen</li>
                <li>You must have a Social Security number</li>
                <li>You must have proof of your identities such as a birth certificate or passport</li>
                <li>You must have two forms of documentation that show your Arizona address such as a utility bill or bank statement</li>
                <li>You will need to provide proof of your name change if it is different from the name on your proof of identity documents</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Now that you know the requirements for an Arizona Travel ID, let’s look at what it will cost you.

            <h2>How Much Does an Arizona Travel ID Cost?</h2>
            <p>
                The cost of the initial application is $25, and it’s valid for eight years. If you need to renew your travel ID, the cost is reduced to $12.50. Keep in mind that you’ll also need to provide proof of identity and residency when applying for the travel ID.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you don’t have a passport or other form of identification, be sure to bring along your birth certificate or naturalization papers. With everything in order, you can relax and enjoy your trip knowing that you’re properly prepared.
            </p>

            <h2>Where Can I Get an Arizona Travel ID?</h2>
            <p>
                You can get an <a href="https://azdot.gov/adot-news/deadline-az-travel-id-delayed-one-year">Arizona travel ID</a> at any GG&D office or authorized third-party provider. You will need to bring the required documents with you and you will need to pay the fee.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you apply for your travel ID, you will have your photograph taken and your fingerprints will be captured. This information will be stored in a secure database and it will be used to verify your identity when you use your travel ID.
